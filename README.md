# Gemini_Explorer
A simple Python web application to interface with a Google Gemini chatbot AI.

Gemini Explorer is a simple Python web application that allows the user to interface with an AI algorithm using the Google Gemini chatbot. The purpose of this project is to become familiar with the fundamentals of using Google Gemini with the Streamlit library.

Gemini Explorer starts by asking the user to enter their name into a text field. That name is then entered into the chatbot's initial greeting. Users can then enter in any prompt they wish, and have the chatbot respond to them.
